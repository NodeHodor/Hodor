title: Alternatives to Ejecting
---

[Ejecting](available-scripts.md#npm-run-eject) lets you customize anything, but from that point on you have to maintain the configuration and scripts yourself. This can be daunting if you have many similar projects. In such cases instead of ejecting we recommend to _fork_ `react-scripts` and any other packages you need. [This article](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-configure-create-react-app/) covers how to do it in depth. You can find more discussion in [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/682).
