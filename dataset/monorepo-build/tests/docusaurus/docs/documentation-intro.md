Welcome to the Create React App documentation!

## Navigation

You can find different topics in the table of contents. On desktop, you should see it in the left sidebar. On mobile, you should see it after pressing an icon with arrows in the top left corner.

## Looking for React Docs?

The documentation for React itself is located on a separate website: **[reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)**.

This website is only about Create React App.

## Something Missing?

If you have ideas for more “How To” recipes that should be on this page, [let us know](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues) or [contribute some!](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/docusaurus/docs)

## Feedback

We are always open to [your feedback](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues).
