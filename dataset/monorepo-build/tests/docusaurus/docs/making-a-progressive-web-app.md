title: Making a Progressive Web App
---

The production build has all the tools necessary to generate a first-class
[Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps),
but **the offline/cache-first behavior is opt-in only**.

Starting with Create React App 4, you can add a `src/service-worker.js` file to
your project to use the built-in support for
[Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)'s
[`InjectManifest`](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-webpack-plugin.InjectManifest)
plugin, which will
[compile](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/using-bundlers)
your service worker and inject into it a list of URLs to
[precache](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/precache-files).

If you start a new project using one of the PWA [custom
templates](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/custom-templates/), you'll get a
`src/service-worker.js` file that serves as a good starting point for an
offline-first service worker:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa
```

The TypeScript equivalent is:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa-typescript
```

If you know that you won't be using service workers, or if you'd prefer to use a
different approach to creating your service worker, don't create a
`src/service-worker.js` file. The `InjectManifest` plugin won't be run in that
case.

In addition to creating your local `src/service-worker.js` file, it needs to be
registered before it will be used. In order to opt-in to the offline-first
behavior, developers should look for the following in their
[`src/index.js`](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/src/index.js)
file:

```js
// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.
// Learn more about service workers: https://cra.link/PWA
serviceWorkerRegistration.unregister();
```

As the comment states, switching `serviceWorker.unregister()` to
`serviceWorker.register()` will opt you in to using the service worker.

## Why Opt-in?

Offline-first Progressive Web Apps are faster and more reliable than traditional
web pages, and provide an engaging mobile experience:

- All static site assets that are a part of your `webpack` build are cached so
  that your page loads fast on subsequent visits, regardless of network
  connectivity (such as 2G or 3G). Updates are downloaded in the background.
- Your app will work regardless of network state, even if offline. This means
  your users will be able to use your app at 10,000 feet and on the subway.
- On mobile devices, your app can be added directly to the user's home screen,
  app icon and all. This eliminates the need for the app store.

However, they [can make debugging deployments more
challenging](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2398).

The
[`workbox-webpack-plugin`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin/)
is integrated into production configuration, and it will take care of compiling
a service worker file that will automatically precache all of your
`webpack`-generated assets and keep them up to date as you deploy updates. The
service worker will use a [cache-first
strategy](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/#cache-falling-back-to-network)
for handling all requests for `webpack`-generated assets, including [navigation
requests](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/high-performance-loading#first_what_are_navigation_requests)
for your HTML, ensuring that your web app is consistently fast, even on a slow
or unreliable network.

Note: Resources that are not generated by `webpack`, such as static files that are
copied over from your local
[`public/` directory](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/tree/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/public/)
or third-party resources, will not be precached. You can optionally set up Workbox
[routes](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/route-requests)
to apply the runtime caching strategy of your choice to those resources.

## Customization

Starting with Create React App 4, you have full control over customizing the
logic in this service worker, by creating your own `src/service-worker.js` file,
or customizing the one added by the `cra-template-pwa` (or
`cra-template-pwa-typescript`) template. You can use [additional
modules](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules) from the
Workbox project, add in a push notification library, or remove some of the
default caching logic. The one requirement is that you keep `self.__WB_MANIFEST`
somewhere in your file, as the Workbox compilation plugin checks for this value
when generating a manifest of URLs to precache. If you would prefer not to use
precaching, you can assign `self.__WB_MANIFEST` to a variable that will be
ignored, like:

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-globals
const ignored = self.__WB_MANIFEST;

// Your custom service worker code goes here.
```

## Offline-First Considerations

If you do decide to opt-in to service worker registration, please take the
following into account:

1. After the initial caching is done, the [service worker lifecycle](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle)
   controls when updated content ends up being shown to users. In order to guard against
   [race conditions with lazy-loaded content](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/3613#issuecomment-353467430),
   the default behavior is to conservatively keep the updated service worker in the "[waiting](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle#waiting)"
   state. This means that users will end up seeing older content until they close (reloading is not
   enough) their existing, open tabs. See [this blog post](https://jeffy.info/2018/10/10/sw-in-c-r-a.html)
   for more details about this behavior.

1. Users aren't always familiar with offline-first web apps. It can be useful to
   [let the user know](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-ux#inform_the_user_when_the_app_is_ready_for_offline_consumption)
   when the service worker has finished populating your caches (showing a "This web
   app works offline!" message) and also let them know when the service worker has
   fetched the latest updates that will be available the next time they load the
   page (showing a "New content is available once existing tabs are closed." message). Showing
   these messages is currently left as an exercise to the developer, but as a
   starting point, you can make use of the logic included in [`src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js`](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js), which
   demonstrates which service worker lifecycle events to listen for to detect each
   scenario, and which as a default, only logs appropriate messages to the
   JavaScript console.

1. Service workers [require HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers#you_need_https),
   although to facilitate local testing, that policy
   [does not apply to `localhost`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34160509/options-for-testing-service-workers-via-http/34161385#34161385).
   If your production web server does not support HTTPS, then the service worker
   registration will fail, but the rest of your web app will remain functional.

1. The service worker is only enabled in the [production environment](deployment.md),
   e.g. the output of `npm run build`. It's recommended that you do not enable an
   offline-first service worker in a development environment, as it can lead to
   frustration when previously cached assets are used and do not include the latest
   changes you've made locally.

1. If you _need_ to test your offline-first service worker locally, build
   the application (using `npm run build`) and run a standard http server from your
   build directory. After running the build script, `create-react-app` will give
   instructions for one way to test your production build locally and the [deployment instructions](deployment.md) have
   instructions for using other methods. _Be sure to always use an
   incognito window to avoid complications with your browser cache._

1. By default, the generated service worker file will not intercept or cache any
   cross-origin traffic, like HTTP [API requests](integrating-with-an-api-backend.md),
   images, or embeds loaded from a different domain. Starting with Create
   React App 4, this can be customized, as explained above.

## Progressive Web App Metadata

The default configuration includes a web app manifest located at
[`public/manifest.json`](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/public/manifest.json), that you can customize with
details specific to your web application.

When a user adds a web app to their homescreen using Chrome or Firefox on
Android, the metadata in [`manifest.json`](https://github.com/cra-template/pwa/blob/master/packages/cra-template-pwa/template/public/manifest.json) determines what
icons, names, and branding colors to use when the web app is displayed.
[The Web App Manifest guide](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/)
provides more context about what each field means, and how your customizations
will affect your users' experience.

Progressive web apps that have been added to the homescreen will load faster and
work offline when there's an active service worker. That being said, the
metadata from the web app manifest will still be used regardless of whether or
not you opt-in to service worker registration.
