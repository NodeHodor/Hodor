# node-key-sender

Use this lib to send keyboard events to the operational system. 

It uses a jar file (Java), so Java Run Time is required on the operational system you are running your node project.

**Bugs and issues**: Please, post any issues to https://github.com/garimpeiro-it/node-key-sender/issues. 

# Main features

- Send raw keyboard key codes to the operational system;
- Send one key;
- Send multiple keys pressed one after the other;
- Send multiple keys pressed together (combination);
- Delay between keys;
- Delay for each pressed key or each combination;
- Possibility to map key codes;
- Case correction for text;
- Multi platform (it will work in all operation systems that Java can run);
- It will send the key to the current focused application in the operational system.

# Installation

Install it using npm:

    npm install --save-dev node-key-sender

The command above will install and add the lib into your "package.json" file.

# How it works

Each key in your keyboard is mapped with a key code. Although a physical keyboard key may have printed above its surface more than one key (for example ':' and ';'), both generate the same key code. So, do not confuse key codes with ASCII or UNICODE values, they are different things.

To make it clear, lets see an example: In american keyboard, the 16 value is the key code for Shift and the 59 value is the key code for the key ":;". So, in this scenario, to send ':' to the operational system, you should use key code 56. To send ';' you should send 16 + 56 as a combination (pressed together). 

In languages that have accents (for example: portuguese and spanish), usually more than one key must be pressed one after another to make the letter with an accent. So 'õ' is the result of sending '~' and 'o'.

While you can send the key codes as numbers, the lib also have labels mapped for most of the keys. So, for key A you may send 'a' or 65. For Shift key you may send 'shift' or 16.

It is possible to change this mapping to convert accents automatically (if you are using a keyboard that supports it). Later in this doc I show how to do that.

Note that key codes may vary according to your running physical keyboard model, keyboard driver and operational system.

# Usage

Sending one key:

    var ks = require('node-key-sender');
    ks.sendKey('a');

Send multiple keys one after the other:

    var ks = require('node-key-sender');
    ks.sendKeys(['a', 'b', 'c']);

Send combination (pressed at the same time):

    var ks = require('node-key-sender');
    ks.sendCombination(['control', 'shift', 'v']);

Mapping accents:

    var accentsMap = {
        'ã': '@514 a',
        'ẽ': '@514 e',
        'ĩ': '@514 i',
        'õ': '@514 o',
        'ũ': '@514 u',
        'Ã': '@514 A',
        'Ẽ': '@514 E',
        'Ĩ': '@514 I',
        'Õ': '@514 O',
        'Ũ': '@514 U',
        'â': 'shift-@514 a',
        'ê': 'shift-@514 e',

        'Ü': 'shift-@54 O'
    };
    
    var ks = require('node-key-sender');
    ks.aggregateKeyboardLayout(accentsMap);
    ks.sendText("Héllõ Wíth Áçcents");

Sending batch:

    var ks = require('node-key-sender');

    ks.startBatch()
        .batchTypeKey('N')
        .batchTypeKey('o')
        .batchTypeKey('d')
        .batchTypeKey('e')
        .batchTypeKeys(['N', 'o', 'd', 'e'])
        .batchTypeText('Node')
        .batchTypeKey('N', 1000)
        .batchTypeKey('o', 1000)
        .batchTypeKey('d', 1000)
        .batchTypeKey('e', 1000)
        .sendBatch();

Setting global press delay (in milliseconds):

    ks.setOption('globalDelayPressMillisec', 1000);
    
Setting global delay between keys (in milliseconds):

    ks.setOption('globalDelayBetweenMillisec', 1000);
    
Setting start delay (in milliseconds):

    ks.setOption('startDelayMillisec', 1000);
    
Turning off case correction:

    ks.setOption('caseCorrection', false);
    
# List of methods

## Economic methods

Use this methods if you want to send just a small amount of keys. Note that the jar file is called each time one of these methods are called:  

**sendKey(keyCode: string): Promise**

Sends one key code.

**sendKeys(arrKeyCodes: array): Promise**

Sends multiple key codes.

**sendLetter(letter: char): Promise**

Sends a letter. A letter will be automatically converted to key code according to the keyboard layout configuration. You may set this configuration with `cleanKeyboardLayout`, `setKeyboardLayout` or `aggregateKeyboardLayout`.

**sendText(text: string): Promise**

Sends a text. A text will have its letters automatically converted to key codes according to the keyboard layout configuration. You may set this configuration with `cleanKeyboardLayout`, `setKeyboardLayout` or `aggregateKeyboardLayout`.

**sendCombination(arrKeyCodes: array): Promise**

Sends multiple key codes pressed together.

## Batch methods

Use this methods to send a large amount of keys. The jar file is executed each time you call `sendBatch`. You should start with `startBatch` and end with `sendBatch`:
 
**startBatch()**
 
Starts a batch.

**sendBatch(): Promise**

Sends the batch.

**batchTypeKey(keyCode: string, waitMillisec: int, batchEvent: int)**

Sends a key code. You may pass a delay it will wait until it presses the next key and also the type of event. Type of event is `ks.BATCH_EVENT_KEY_PRESS`, `ks.BATCH_EVENT_KEY_UP` and `ks.BATCH_EVENT_KEY_DOWN`.

**batchTypeKeys(arrKeyCodes: array)**

Sends a list of key codes, pressed one after the other.

**batchTypeCombination(arrKeys: array, waitMillisec: int, batchEvent: int)**

Sends a combination - list of key codes that will be pressed together. You may pass a delay it will wait until it presses the next key and also the type of event. Type of event is `ks.BATCH_EVENT_KEY_PRESS`, `ks.BATCH_EVENT_KEY_UP` and `ks.BATCH_EVENT_KEY_DOWN`.

**batchTypeText(text: string)**

Sends a text. A text will have its letters automatically converted to key codes according to the keyboard layout configuration. You may set this configuration with `cleanKeyboardLayout`, `setKeyboardLayout` or `aggregateKeyboardLayout`.


## Keyboard layout methods

Keyboard layout methods affects translation of letter to key code. They affect `sendLetter`, `sendText`, `batchTypeText` and `getKeyCode` methods. 

**cleanKeyboardLayout(): void**

Resets the keyboard layout configuration.

**setKeyboardLayout(newKeyMap: object): void**

Sets a new keyboard layout. For example:

    var keyboardLayout = {
        'ç': '@192 c',
        'Ç': '@192 C'
    };
        
    var ks = require('node-key-sender');
    ks.aggregateKeyboardLayout(keyboardLayout);
    ks.sendText("Ç");

This keyboard layout converts letter 'Ç' to key codes '@192' and 'C'.
 
**aggregateKeyboardLayout(objKeyMap: object): void**

Appends the new mapping to the current mapping.

**getKeyboardLayout(): object**

Returns the current keyboard layout.


## Other methods

**getKeyCode(letter: string)**

Gets the key code of a letter. A letter will be automatically converted to key code according to the keyboard layout configuration. You may set this configuration with `cleanKeyboardLayout`, `setKeyboardLayout` or `aggregateKeyboardLayout`.

**setOption(optionName: string, optionValue: string)**

Options that are passed as arguments to the jar. This is the list of valid options names:

- startDelayMillisec (int): Delay in milliseconds it will wait to press the first key.
- globalDelayPressMillisec (int): Global delay in milliseconds it will keep the key pressed.
- globalDelayBetweenMillisec (int): Global delay in milliseconds it will wait until it presses the next key.
- caseCorrection (boolean): When it is on, if you send key 'A' (in upper case), the jar will automatically hold Shift, so resulting key is 'A'.
- extra (string): Use may use it to send raw arguments to the jar file. Example: ' -c 1 -d 1000'.

**execute(arrParams: array): Promise**

Use this method if you want to directly call the jar file.

## Promises

Some methods of this lib returns a promise:

    ks.sendKey('a').then(
        function(stdout, stderr) {
            // For success
        },        
        function(error, stdout, stderr) {
            // For error
        }
    );

The promise is resolved or rejected right after the jar finishes its execution.  

List of methods that returns this promise: `sendCombination`, `sendKey`, `sendKeys`, `sendLetter`, `sendText`, `execute`, `sendBatch`.


# List of key codes

We recommend you search for key codes in the Java [java.awt.event.KeyEvent](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html) class doc. The key codes are the constants starting with "VK_". To use it with this lib, just take out these three letters and you can use the rest of the constant name. For example, VK_SHIFT constant you use "shift". VK_A constant you use 'a'. The constant numerical value can also be used with an "@" in the beginning. So "@16" for VK_SHIFT and "@65" for VK_A.

Use this website to get an idea of what key code is bound to each key of your current keyboard: https://www.w3.org/2002/09/tests/keys.html.

Below, the list of key codes:
